# 🏆 Ballon d’Or PR Influence Analysis  
### *A Data Science Project Exploring How Performance, Awards, and Public Attention Shape Ballon d’Or Votes*

---

## 📌 Overview

This project investigates **what drives Ballon d’Or voting outcomes**, combining:

- ✔ Player performance metrics  
- ✔ Awards across competitions  
- ✔ Advanced ratings  
- ✔ **PR metrics** (Google Trends + Wikipedia Page Views)  
- ✔ Machine Learning models  
- ✔ Clustering & nonlinear modeling insights  

The repository includes a full pipeline from **data collection → EDA → feature engineering → modeling and insights**.

This work reveals deep patterns behind football’s most prestigious individual award and answers a key question:

> **Does PR influence Ballon d’Or outcomes — and if so, how?**

## 🧠 Project Goals

### 1. **Collect & unify football performance datasets**
Includes domestic leagues, UCL, World Cup, continental tournaments, ratings, and awards.

### 2. **Engineer meaningful features**
- Ratings (League, UCL, WC, etc.)  
- Awards (Best Player, Top Scorer, etc.)  
- Positional indicators  
- PR features (Google Trends, Wikipedia)

### 3. **Analyze patterns & correlations**
Identify which features correlate strongly with vote share.

### 4. **Model Ballon d’Or vote share**
Using:
- Linear Regression (Ridge)
- Logistic Regression
- Polynomial + Interaction Models
- XGBoost
- Agglomerative Clustering

### 5. **Uncover nonlinear PR effects**
Determine how PR interacts with performance to shape outcomes.

## 🔍 Key Insights (High-Level Summary)

### 🥇 **UCL Best Player is the strongest single predictor**
Across all models (logistic, ridge, XGBoost), the **Champions League Best Player award** dominates.

### 🌍 **International awards matter heavily**
Copa América, Euros, AFCON, World Cup Best Player significantly boost vote share.

### 🎯 **PR metrics matter — but nonlinearly**
- **Wiki Page Views** = strong correlation + huge impact in nonlinear models  
- **Google Trends** = small additive effect, big nonlinear effect  
- PR improves predictions only in tree-based / interaction models

### 📉 **Linear models reject PR**
Ridge Regression shows PR adds noise due to multicollinearity.

### ⚽ **Voters favor peak performances, not raw stats**
Awards outperform goals or assists.

### 🧩 **Clustering reveals types of candidates**
Clusters separate:
- UCL-dominant players  
- PR-dominant players  
- International-tournament spikes  
- Mixed-achievement profiles  
- Outlier years (e.g., historic seasons)

## 📊 Modeling Techniques Used

### Supervised Models  
- **Ridge Regression**  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Polynomial Logistic Regression**  
- **XGBoost Regressor**

### Unsupervised Learning  
- **Agglomerative Clustering** to identify player archetypes.

### Evaluation Metrics  
- R², MSE, Odds Ratios, Feature Importances, Coefficients

---

## 🚀 Results Summary

- **Performance + Awards** = best baseline predictors  
- **PR amplifies differences**, especially when combined with strong performance  
- **Wiki Page Views becomes the #2 most important feature** in XGBoost  
- **Google Trends becomes meaningful only in tree-based models**  
- **Nonlinearity is essential** for capturing real-world PR effects  
- **UCL + international tournaments define the Ballon d’Or hierarchy**
